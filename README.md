# Momento-Mori-Ad-Infinitum
 Your last memory is of hitting a patch of black ice before colliding head on with that tree..
However, this final moment right before you die begins to feel like more than a moment. 
As your brain begins to die you are left with only one option, hide away your conciousness 
in the deepest parts of your psyche. You need more time. Delve deeper as you race against your
own neurological death. Make this moment last.
